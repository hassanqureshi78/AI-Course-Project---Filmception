# AI-Course-Project---Filmception
An AI-powered system for processing movie summaries, predicting genres, and generating multilingual audio translations. Using the dataset downloaded from the website Kaggle.com, Movie Summary Dataset, the system preprocesses data, trains a multi-label genre classification model, translates summaries into Arabic, Urdu, and Korean, and converts them to audio. A Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) enhances user interaction. The project fulfills all specified requirements, achieving robust preprocessing, accurate predictions, and seamless multilingual functionality, with modular code and comprehensive evaluations.
